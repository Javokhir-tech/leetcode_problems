## Merge Sort
Merge sort is a typical text-book example of a recursive algorithm and the poster-child of the divide and conquer strategy. The idea is very simple, we divide the array into two equal parts, sort them recursively and then combine the two sorted arrays. The base case for recursion occurs when the size of the array reaches a single element. An array consisting of a single element is already sorted.
